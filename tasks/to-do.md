# Tasks / plan

**Default mode: plan here first, then execute.**  
Statuses: `todo` · `doing` · `blocked` · `done` · `later`

## Plan (current)

- [x] Seed `memory/` `references/` `tasks/` `lessons/` + protocol
- [x] Add `AGENTS.md` so coding agents know memory + how to code
- [x] Reframe `references/` = external research; seed Claude/Cursor/Apple/competitors
- [x] Agree Track A success cases S1–S8 (H1–H3 home-only)
- [x] Write Track A plan → `tasks/track-a-plan.md`
- [x] User **go** on Track A plan → implement
- [x] Write Track B plan → `tasks/track-b-plan.md`
- [x] User **go** on Track B (confirm S9–S12) → implement
- [x] Track B S10→S9→S11→S12 + verify:track-b green
- [x] Independent core-loop technical + outcome audit → `docs/core-loop-failure-analysis.md`
- [x] Three-phase remediation roadmap; Phase 1 build plan → `docs/core-loop-remediation-plan.md`
- [x] User reviews/approves Phase 1 scope → then implement P1.1–P1.5
- [x] Implement Phase 1 P1.1–P1.5 + remote acceptance suite (`verify:phase1-remediation`)
- [x] Create Phase 2 execution plan + model handoff → `docs/phase2-execution-plan.md`
- [x] User approves Phase 2 scope → implement P2.1–P2.6
- [x] Implement Phase 2 P2.1–P2.6 + verify:phase2-surface
- [ ] Home Phase 1 checks (`docs/HOME-PHASE1.md`) when back at laptop
- [ ] Home Phase 2 checks (`docs/HOME-PHASE2.md`) when back at laptop
- [ ] E6 Cursor Resume strategy note — later / optional after B

### Track A checklist (after go)

- [x] Headless bridge harness (no Electron UI)
- [x] Named S1–S8 asserts in verify path
- [x] Fill S5 error (+ cursor approval POST); S3/S6 harden as planned
- [x] `npm run verify:track-a` green here
- [x] Update memory/status + PR

## Home-only (user laptop — do not fake as done)

- [ ] `npm run dev` + reload Cursor → rings, no Approve spam
- [ ] Restart Claude → Write `ryu-live-test.txt` → dock Approve → file exists
- [ ] If Claude Yes/No only → `npm run hook:install` (Windows) + check `~/.ryu/hook.log`

## Engineering backlog (remote-capable)

| ID | Task | Value | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| E1 | Harden bridge/hook `verify:*` with named stage asserts | Trust that Decide/Resume is real | done |
| E2 | Codex status+permission verify parity | Multi-agent demo | done |
| E3 | Phase 2 queue plumbing + fixtures | Parallel permissions | done |
| E4 | In-dock dismiss stale cards | Attention quality | done |
| E5 | Ring watchdog (no stuck green) | Signal quality | done |
| E6 | Cursor Resume strategy note (ACP vs selective) | Unblock Cursor product loop | todo |
| E7 | Clean PR of working Windows path | Known-good home baseline | todo |
| E8 | Phase 1 decision integrity/recovery (P1.1–P1.5) | Prevent invisible/false/over-broad decisions | done (remote); home open |
| E9 | Phase 2 truthful usable surface (P2.1–P2.6) | Clear context + honest statuses | done (remote); home open |
| E10 | Phase 3 production proof/expansion gate | Test shipped Electron + live integrations | later |
